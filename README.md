## 🧑‍💻 Contribution Flow (Daily Practice)

Here’s the workflow I follow daily:

1. **Create a new branch** from `main`  
2. **Work on changes** (docs, notes, commands, experiments, etc.)
3. `git add .`  
4. `git commit -m "brief message"`  
5. `git push origin <branch-name>`  
6. **Create a Pull Request**  
7. **Merge & delete branch if appropriate**

> Repeat this process with purpose: 10–15 small commits daily builds real skill.
